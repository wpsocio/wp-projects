== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest way -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin:
 
* Log in to your WordPress dashboard
* Navigate to the Plugins menu, and click "Add New"
* In the search field type "wptelegram-comments" and hit Enter
* Locate the plugin in the list of search results
* Click on "Install Now" and wait for the installation to complete
* Click on "Activate"

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The official WordPress documentation contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
